## The Mnemonica Stack

The Mnemonica Stack is a memorized deck system created by Juan Tamariz, one of the most influential card magicians of the modern era. It's a predetermined order of all 52 playing cards that allows performers to accomplish powerful magical effects through its clever mathematical properties and built-in relationships between cards.
